# MicroK8s Addons

To be as lightweight as possible, MicroK8s only installs the basics of a usable
Kubernetes install:

 - api-server
 - controller-manager
 - scheduler
 - kubelet
 - cni
 - kube-proxy

While this does deliver a pure Kubernetes experience with the smallest of
resource footprints, there are situations where you may require additional
services. MicroK8s caters for this with the concept of "Addons" - extra
services which can easily be added to MicroK8s. These addons can be enabled
and disabled at any time, and most are pre-configured to 'just work' without
any further set up.

For example, to enable the CoreDNS addon:

```bash
microk8s.enable dns
```

These add-ons can be disabled at anytime using the `disable` command:

```bash
microk8s.disable dns
```

... and you can check the list of available and installed addons at any time
by running:

```bash
microk8s.status
```

## Current MicroK8s Addons

[**dashboard**](addon-dashboard): The standard Kubernetes Dashboard.

[**dns**](addon-dns): Deploys CoreDNS. This add-on may be required by others - it is
recommended you always enable it. In restricted environments you may need to
update the upstream DNS servers.

**cilium**: Deploys [Cilium][cilium-doc] to support Kubernetes network policies using eBPF.

**[fluentd](addon-fluentd)**: Deploy the [Elasticsearch-Fluentd-Kibana][kibana-docs] logging and
monitoring solution.

[**gpu**](addon-gpu):  Enable support for GPU accelerated workloads using the NVIDIA runtime.

**helm**: Installs the [Helm 2][] package manager for Kubernetes. 

**ingress**: A simple ingress controller for external access.

**istio**: Adds the core [Istio][istio-docs] services.

**jaeger**: Deploy the [Jaeger Operator][jaeger-docs] in the “simplest”
configuration.

**juju**: Enables a [juju][] client to work with MicroK8s.

**knative**: Adds the [Knative][knative-docs] middleware to your cluster.

**kubeflow**: Adds [KubeFlow][] using the [kubeflow juju bundle][kubeflow-bundle].

**[linkerd](/docs/addon-linkerd)**: Deploys the [linkerd][linkerd-docs] service mesh.

**metrics-server**: Adds the [Kubernetes Metrics Server][metrics-design-doc]
for API access to service metrics.

**prometheus**: Deploys the [Prometheus Operator][prometheus-docs].

**rbac**: Enable Role Based Access Control for authorisation. Note that this is
incompatible with some other add-ons.

**registry**: Deploy a private image registry and expose it on localhost:32000.
The storage add-on will be enabled as part of this add-on. See the registry
documentation for more details.

**storage**: Create a default storage class which allocates storage from a
host directory.

**metallb**: Deploys the [MetalLB Loadbalancer][metallb].  Note that currently this does not
work under multipass on macOS, due to filtering that macOS applies to network traffic.
