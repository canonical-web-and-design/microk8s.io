# Release channels and upgrades

Microk8s is a snap deploying Kubernetes. Upstream Kubernetes ships a new release about
every three months, while old releases get periodic updates. Currently, the latest release
series is `v1.14` with `v1.14.1` being the latest release. On the `v1.13` series, `v1.13.6`
is the latest release. It is important to remember that upstream Kubernetes is committed
to maintain backwards compatibility only within a release series. That means that
your Kubernetes will not break when you upgrade from `v1.14.x` to `v1.14.y` but may
break if you upgrade from `v1.13.x` to `v1.14.z`.


## Choosing the right channel

When installing MicroK8s you can select your desired upstream Kubernetes series with the
corresponding snap channel. All channels are shown with `snap info microk8s`:

```

  1.12/candidate: v1.12.8         2019-05-01 (547) 259MB classic
  1.12/beta:      v1.12.8         2019-05-01 (547) 259MB classic
  1.12/edge:      v1.12.8         2019-04-24 (547) 259MB classic
  1.11/stable:    v1.11.10        2019-05-10 (557) 258MB classic
  1.11/candidate: v1.11.10        2019-05-02 (557) 258MB classic
  1.11/beta:      v1.11.10        2019-05-02 (557) 258MB classic
  1.11/edge:      v1.11.10        2019-05-01 (557) 258MB classic
  1.10/stable:    v1.10.13        2019-04-22 (546) 222MB classic
  1.10/candidate: v1.10.13        2019-04-22 (546) 222MB classic
  1.10/beta:      v1.10.13        2019-04-22 (546) 222MB classic
  1.10/edge:      v1.10.13        2019-04-22 (546) 222MB classic
```

To install MicroK8s and let it follow the `v1.14` release series you:

```
snap install microk8s --classic --channel=1.14/stable
```

If you omit the `--channel` argument MicroK8s will follow the latest stable upstream
Kubernetes. This means that your deployment will eventually upgrade to a new release
series. For example, at the time of writing you will get `v1.14.1` with:

```
snap install microk8s --classic
```

Since no `--channel` is specified, such a deployment will eventually upgrade to `v1.15.0`.


## Tracks with stable releases

The `*/stable` channels serve the latest stable upstream Kubernetes release of the
respective release series. Upstream releases are propagated to the MicroK8s snap in about
a week. This means your MicroK8s will upgrade to the latest upstream release in your
selected channel roughly one week after the upstream release.

The `*/candidate` and `*/beta` channels get updated within hours of an upstream release.
Getting a MicroK8s deployment pointing to `1.14/beta` is as simple as:

```
snap install microk8s --classic --channel=1.14/beta
```

The `*/edge` channels get updated on each MicroK8s patch or upstream Kubernetes patch release.

Keep in mind that edge and beta are snap constructs and do not relate to specific
Kubernetes release names.


## Tracks with pre-stable releases

On tracks where no stable Kubernetes release is available, MicroK8s ships pre-release versions
under the following scheme:

- The `*/edge` channel (eg `1.15/edge`) holds the alpha upstream releases. 
- The `*/beta` channel (eg `1.15/beta`) holds the beta upstream releases.
- The `*/candidate` channel (eg `1.15/candidate`) holds the release candidate of upstream releases.

Pre-release versions will be available the same day they are released upstream. 

For example, assuming `v1.14` is the latest stable release, to test your work against the
alpha `v1.15` release simply run:

```
sudo snap install microk8s --classic --channel=1.5/edge
```

However, be aware that pre-release versions may require you to configure the K8s services on your own.


## I am confused. Which channel is right for me?

The single question you need to focus on is what channel should be used below:

```
sudo snap install microk8s --classic --channel=<which_channel?>
```

Here are some suggestions for the channel to use based on your needs:

 - I want to always be on the latest stable Kubernetes.

   -- Use `--channel=latest`

 - I want to always be on the latest release in a specific upstream K8s release.

   -- Use `--channel=<release>/stable`, eg `--channel=1.14/stable`. 

 - I want to test-drive a pre-stable release.

   -- Use `--channel=<next_release>/edge` for alpha releases.

   -- Use `--channel=<next_release>/beta` for beta releases.

   -- Use `--channel=<next_release>/candidate` for candidate releases.

 - I am waiting for a bug fix on MicroK8s:

   -- Use `--channel=<release>/edge`.

 - I am waiting for a bug fix on upstream Kubernetes:

   -- Use `--channel=<release>/candidate`.
